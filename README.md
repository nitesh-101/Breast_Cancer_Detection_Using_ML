# üéóÔ∏è Breast Cancer Detection Using Machine Learning
A Streamlit web application that uses **Machine Learning models** to predict whether a tumor is **Benign** or **Malignant** based on diagnostic features from the breast cancer dataset.
**INTRODUCTION**:
Breast cancer is a significant health concern worldwide. Leveraging machine learning can provide a valuable tool for assisting medical professionals in early diagnosis, potentially leading to timely interventions and improved survival rates. This project aims to:
* Explore the effectiveness of various machine learning algorithms in breast cancer detection.
* Build a robust and reliable predictive model.
* Provide a clear and understandable implementation for educational and research purposes.

## Dataset

This project utilizes the **Wisconsin Breast Cancer (Diagnostic) Dataset**, which is readily available within the `scikit-learn` library. This dataset comprises features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of a breast mass. These features describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. The target variable indicates whether the diagnosis is malignant or benign.

* **Source:** `sklearn.datasets` (Wisconsin Breast Cancer (Diagnostic) Dataset)
* **Key Features:** radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, fractal dimension (mean, standard error, and "worst" or largest mean value of these features were computed for each image, resulting in 30 features).
* **Number of Instances:** 569
* **Number of Features:** 30
